My name is Joseph Kouame-Waldman and I'm from Los Angeles, California. As a college senior majoring in the social sciences, I have avoided STEM classes for as long as possible. However, I need to graduate! And in order to do so, I must take one more STEM class. Not only is this course one of the least intimidating STEM courses on campus, but it is quite literally designed for STEM newbies like me. Have I ever coded? Absolutely not! Would I describe myself as very creative? Nope! But I'm excited to learn practical skills that I can take with me regardless of what I decide to pursue.
