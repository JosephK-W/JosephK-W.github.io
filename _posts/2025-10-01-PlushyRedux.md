**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with coding a program that would copy the behavior of our plushy by printing whether LEDs would be on or off. The light's behavior would be determined based on the button and the switch variables.

**My Tip:**\
I would recommend writing out the logic of the code on a separate piece of paper. Doing so helped me workout how I would translate the different conditionals to the programmed code.

This is a screenshot of my debug console which displays the output of my code.
