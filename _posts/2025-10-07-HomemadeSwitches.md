**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with adding a circuit to our sewing sampler. The circuit was supposed to consist of a battery, two switches and one LED. One of the switches was made from conductive-thread-patches and the second one could be any different homemade switch. The goal was that when the circuit was closed the LED light on the sampler would light up.

**My Tip:**\
Since my LED light was unable to turn on, I would spend more time in the prototyping stage to make sure that my circuit was complete. I would also decide to have a potenital backup component (switch in this case) so that if my circuit failed once sewn on, I could have a potential solution.

This is the alligator prototyping stage of the assignment. This is how I tested the circuit before sewing the componenets on to my sampler.

This is the paper prototyping stage of the assignment. I outlined all of the components of the circuit to help me organize the circuit correctly.
