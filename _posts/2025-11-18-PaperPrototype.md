**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a paper prototype of our final project. The goal was to clearly detail the circuit design, including all of the components we plan on using in our project. It was also important to label the positive and negative traces of the circuit to make sure our circuit design was correct.

This is a picture of my paper prototype. In it, you can see my detailed sketch of the circuit design of my final project.
