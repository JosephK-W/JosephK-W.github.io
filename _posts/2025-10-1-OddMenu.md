**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with coding if, else if, and else statements. The goal was to use a temperature integer to determine the appropriate clothing items for the specific temperature. Depending on the weather, the hypothetical outfit would change.

**My Tip:**\
Since coding is still so new to me, it's crucial that I pay attention to detail and remain patient. I've found it much easier to code when I'm not worried about making mistakes.
