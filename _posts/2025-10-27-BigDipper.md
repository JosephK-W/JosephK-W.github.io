**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos to create a flashing LED for the desired output. This flashing LED modeled the Big Dipper firefly and would light up every three seconds, increasing in brightness until turning off once it reached maximum brightness.

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to pay attention to the labeling of my variables. I had to go back into the code multiple times because the capitalization of my variables wasn't the same throughout my code.

This is a picture of my arduino which displays the flashing LED.
