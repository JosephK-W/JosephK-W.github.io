**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with coding a program that would use a while loop to print if LEDs were on as well as their specified color. The goal was to have the program print whether the lights were red, green, or blue every 10th time.

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to pay attention to the indentation of my code as well as touch up on my use of modular arithmetic. The while loop required me to really plan my code out logically so it was very important for the code to be formatted clearly.

This is a screenshot of my debug console which displays the output of my code.
