**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos to turn on the red LEDs based on different brightness environments (turn on when in a dark setting). 

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to pay attention to my alligator clips because if my sensor wasn't connected properly, the LED wouldn't turn on and my code became more difficult to debug.

This is a picture of my arduino which displays the circuit's connections. Since this photo was taken in a bright setting the light sensor isn't detecting an approiate amount of brightness to cause the LED to turn on.
