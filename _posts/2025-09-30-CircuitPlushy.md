**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating our very own light-up plushy. We had to use conductive thread, a slide switch, and a button to create a circuit that would appropriately light up LEDs sewn onto our plushy.

**My Tip:**\
I would definitely recommend using shorter pieces of conductive thread for sewing the circuit onto the plushy. The conductive thread would get easily tangled which was frustrating as it made the sewing component a lot more difficult and time consuming.
