**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos emit two different patterns of Morse code depending on if the circuit was opened or closed. The sounds would come from the Buzzer of our arduino.

**My Tip:**\
It was crucial to plan out the different steps of code I needed to complete for the two differing functions. After figuring out what was logically needed for each function, I was able to determine how to code the patterns of Morse code to the buzzer.
