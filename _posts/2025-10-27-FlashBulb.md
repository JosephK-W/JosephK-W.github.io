**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos to create a flashing light for the desired output. This flashing light modeled the Flash Bulb firefly and would light up for half a second every four seconds. 

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to borrow a usb c adapter so that I could work on this assignment on my personal computer.

This is a picture of my arduino which displays the flashing LED.
