**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with coding a program that would print various meal options on two different menus. Depending on the integer variables, menu options would be selected from a regular or secret menu.

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to pay attention to the indentation of my code. By clearly separating the if statements, I was able to accurately code my program.
