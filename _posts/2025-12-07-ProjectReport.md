**Assignment Description**\
For our final project we were tasked with creating any electronic textile as long as it included 2 Inputs and 2 Outputs. There needed to be at least 1 analog input, 1 analog output, and at least one output controlled by the input.

**My Final Project:**\
For my final project, I created a running headband that lights up in the dark and adjusts LED brightness depending on the environment. The headband uses a LilyPad Arduino, light sensor, and a button sewn into the fabric. The light sensor detects brightness and controls the LEDs so that when it's bright outside, the lights stay off. When it's dark outside, the LEDs will turn on or start blinking. The button lets the user switch between different modes, like steady or blinking. The circuit is powered by a battery which will connect directly to the Arduino. As a runner, I know some of the best miles begin after dark. Now, you'll shine with every step you take!​​

**Materials:**\
1 LilyPad Arduino​
1 LilyPad Battery​
1 LilyPad Light Sensor​
1 LilyPad Button​
1 LilyPad LED
1 RGB LED​
1 Headband​
Conductive Thread​

**My Tips:**\
The three tips I have for my past self are about using conductive thread, circuit design, and sewing electric components. First, it was extremely helpful to use short pieces of conductive thread. Conductive thread knots really easily so by using shorter pieces, I was able to create secure circuit connecctions and avoid lots of frustration from the thread knotting. Second, I realized that my original paper prototype didn't account for the actual trace patterns I would need once I sewed the components onto my headband. Because circuit traces crossing over each other would cause short circuits, it was helpful to create a paper prototype that outlined all of my traces clearly. Lastly, using an embroidery loop was so helpful for sewing the components onto my headband. My headband material was quite elastic so by using the loop to secure the part of the headband I was sewing, I was easily able to attatch the electrical components.

**Paper Prototype**\

This is the paper prototyping stage of the assignment. I outlined all of the components of the circuit to help me organize the circuit correctly.

**Alligator Prototype**\

This is the alligator prototyping stage of the assignment. This is how I tested the circuit before sewing the componenets onto my headband.

**HOW IT WORKS**

**Auto Mode**\
