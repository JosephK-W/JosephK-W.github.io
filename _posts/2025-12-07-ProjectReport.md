**Assignment Description**\
For our final project we were tasked with creating any electronic textile as long as it included 2 Inputs and 2 Outputs. There needed to be at least 1 analog input, 1 analog output, and at least one output controlled by the input.

**My Final Project:**\
For my final project, I created a running headband that lights up in the dark and adjusts LED brightness depending on the environment. The headband uses a LilyPad Arduino, light sensor, and a button sewn into the fabric. The light sensor detects brightness and controls the LEDs so that when it's bright outside, the lights stay off. When it's dark outside, the LEDs will turn on or start blinking. The button lets the user switch between different modes, like steady or blinking. The circuit is powered by a battery which will connect directly to the Arduino. As a runner, I know some of the best miles begin after dark. Now, you'll shine with every step you take!​​

**Materials:**\
1 LilyPad Arduino​
1 LilyPad Battery​
1 LilyPad Light Sensor​
1 LilyPad Button​
1 LilyPad LED
1 RGB LED​
1 Headband​
Conductive Thread​

**My Tips:**\
I would definitely recommend using shorter pieces of conductive thread for sewing the circuit onto the plushy. The conductive thread would get easily tangled which was frustrating as it made the sewing component a lot more difficult and time consuming.

**Paper Prototype**\

This is the paper prototyping stage of the assignment. I outlined all of the components of the circuit to help me organize the circuit correctly.

**Alligator Prototype**\

This is the alligator prototyping stage of the assignment. This is how I tested the circuit before sewing the componenets onto my headband.
