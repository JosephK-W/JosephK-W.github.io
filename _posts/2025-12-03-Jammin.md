**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos to play a song when the slide switch was flipped on.

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to pick a basic song so that I didn't confuse myself when coding the song's notes and duration (the lengths of each note).
