**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos to turn a random PVM pin on and off. The pin would also be set to a random value each time.

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to keep track of the length of the array so that if the length changed, I only needed to change the variable.

This is a picture of my arduino which displays the flashing LEDs.
