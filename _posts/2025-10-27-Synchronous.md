**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we were tasked with programming our arduinos to create a flashing LED for the desired output. This flashing LED modeled the Synchronous firefly and would light up every 10 seconds in a series of 3 flashes.

**My Tip:**\
It was super helpful to  clearly organize the curly brackets in my code. I often didn't properly format or forgot the brackets so I had to debug my code multiple times because it wouldn't run properly.

This is a picture of my arduino which displays the flashing LED.
