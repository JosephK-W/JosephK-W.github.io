**I'm Joseph Kouame-Waldman**

**I'm from Los Angeles, California**

**Class of 2026**

**Political Science and Africana Major**

**Experience:**
I have no sewing experience as well as no programming experience. 

**I hope to learn practical sewing and programming basics. Given I have no experience when it comes to computer science, I hope this course helps me broaden my understanding of technology and AI. Also, this course will challenge me to be creative in many new ways.**

**One fact about me is that I have one younger sibling (sister) and we have a 9 year age gap.**
