**Assignment Description**\
For this assignment, we combined all of the firefly flashes into one code. The goal was to light up all three LED patterns on our arduinos at the same time. 

**My Tip:**\
It was important to review and revise my variables so that the code could run properly. Because I was combining the codes from all of the different firefly flashes, I had to make sure there was no overlap between them.

This is a picture of my arduino which displays all of the flashing LEDs.
